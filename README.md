# Agile + Infra Mashup Starter Kit

Automates pre-product backlog intake with Go/No-Go decision gates and priority labeling via GitHub Actions. Built for teams who want lightweight infrastructure magic without a DevOps budget.

* **Priority Automation**: Labels tasks as Critical, Urgent, High, or Day-2 automatically.
